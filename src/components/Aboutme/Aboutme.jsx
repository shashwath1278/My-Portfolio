        Hi, I'm Shashwath, a second-year ISE student at MSRIT, Bangalore, with a passion for ethical hacking, web development, and coding. Skilled in JavaScript, Python, C, C++, and Java, I’m preparing for CPTS and OSEP exams to pursue pen-testing. As a FIDE-rated chess player, I thrive in hackathons and CTF events. I’m constantly refining my technical skills through hands-on experience in ethical hacking and cybersecurity. Always on the lookout for exciting opportunities in software development and cybersecurity, I’m eager to innovate and collaborate. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
